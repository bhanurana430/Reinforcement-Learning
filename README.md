# 🤖 Reinforcement Learning Experiments

Welcome to my **Reinforcement Learning (RL) repository**! 🚀  

This repository contains implementations of **various RL algorithms** applied to different environments, including **Super Mario** and **Trading simulations**. It serves as a learning space where I explore **deep reinforcement learning**, experiment with different architectures, and apply RL to real-world problems.
